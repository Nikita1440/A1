    "Generators and iterators are closely related concepts:\n",
    "Generators: A generator is a type of iterable that generates a sequence of values dynamically, on-demand. It is implemented using a special kind of function called a generator function, which uses the yield statement to yield values one at a time. Generators are memory-efficient and suitable for handling large or infinite sequences of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterators: An iterator is an object that represents a stream of data and provides a way to traverse that data. Iterators must implement the __iter__() and __next__() methods. Generators are a type of iterator, but not all iterators are generators. Iterators can be created using classes or by defining custom objects that implement the required iterator methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, generators are a specific type of iterator that uses generator functions and the yield statement to produce values lazily, whereas iterators, in general, can be implemented using various techniques and provide a way to traverse a sequence of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3\n",
    "A function is considered a generator function if it contains the yield statement. The presence of the yield statement indicates that the function will generate a sequence of values and can be used as an iterator. Generator functions are defined using the def keyword like regular functions, but they have one or more yield statements instead of a return statement.\n",
