    "The feature responsible for generating Regex objects in Python is the re module. The re module provides functions and methods for working with regular expressions.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2\n",
    "Raw strings (r\"...\") often appear in Regex objects to avoid unwanted escape sequences. In regular expressions, backslashes (\\) are used to escape special characters. However, Python also uses backslashes as escape characters in string literals. To simplify the process of writing regular expressions, raw strings are used because they treat backslashes as literal characters and prevent the interpretation of escape sequences. This allows regular expressions to be written more clearly and concisely.\n",
    "# 3 \n",
    "The search() method in Python's re module returns a match object if the pattern is found in the string being searched, and None if no match is found. The match object contains information about the match, including the matched substring, its position, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4\n",
    "To get the actual strings that match the pattern from a match object, you can use the group() method. Calling group() without any arguments returns the entire matched substring. If capturing groups are used in the regular expression pattern, you can pass a group number or a group name to group() to retrieve specific captured substrings.\n",
