    "Learning to ride a bike: When someone learns to ride a bike, they start with little to no knowledge of how to balance and steer. Through trial and error, they gradually develop the skills and coordination necessary to ride on their own. This is an example of experiential learning, where knowledge is gained through direct experience and practice.\n",

Through exposure to the language in different contexts (such as reading, listening, and speaking), they gradually improve their ability to understand and communicate in the language. This is an example of instructional learning, where knowledge is gained through formal instruction and guidance."

The hospital has a large dataset of electronic health records (EHRs) that includes information such as age, gender, medical history, diagnosis, and medications for each patient.\n",

    "Algorithms: There are various machine learning algorithms that can be used for this task, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. The choice of algorithm will depend on the specific problem, data, and performance requirements.\n",

Thus, achieving good generalization is a critical component of successful machine learning.\n",
